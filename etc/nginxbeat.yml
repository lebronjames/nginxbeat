############################# Input ############################################
input:
  # URL to Nginx status page.
  url: http://127.0.0.1:8080/status

  # Format of the status page, either "stub" or "json".
  # Use "stub" for Nginx stub status page.
  # Use "json" for Nginx Plus status page.
  # NOTE: Only "stub" is supported right now.
  format: stub

  # In seconds, defines how often to read statistics.
  period: 10


############################# Output ##########################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# You can enable one or multiple outputs by setting enabled option to true.
output:

  ### Console as output
  console:

    # Enabling console output
    enabled: true

    # pretty print json event
    pretty: false

  ### Elasticsearch as output
  elasticsearch:

    # Set to true to enable elasticsearch output
    enabled: true

    # A list of Elasticsearch hosts. If the connection to the first host fails, it connects to the second one.
    # A host can be defined as an IP:PORT or an URL with the format: scheme://IP:PORT/path. In case you specify and
    # additional path, the scheme is required. The defaults are ( port is 9200, path is '/', scheme is http).
    # In case of an IPv6 address, please use http://[2001:db8::1]:9200.
    hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]

    # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials. These are deprectad
    # protocol: "https"
    # username: "admin"
    # password: "s3cr3t"

    # Optional index name. The default is "nginxbeat" and generates
    # [nginxbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD keys.
    # index: "nginxbeat"

    # Optional HTTP Path
    # path: "/elasticsearch"

    # The number of times a particular Elasticsearch index operation is attempted. If
    # the indexing operation doesn't succeed after this many retries, the events are
    # dropped. The default is 3.
    # max_retries: 3

    # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Elasticsearch bulk API index request.
    # The default is 10000.
    # bulk_max_size: 10000

    # The number of seconds to wait for new events between two bulk API index requests.
    # If `bulk_max_size` is reached before this interval expires, addition bulk index
    # requests are made.
    # flush_interval

    # The time to live in seconds for the topology information that is stored in
    # Elasticsearch. The default is 15 seconds.
    # topology_expire:

    # tls configuration
    # tls:
      # If disabled is set to true, the tls section will be ignored and the
      # host its certificate authorities will be used.
      # disabled: true

      # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
      # certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

      # Certificate for TLS client authentication
      # certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

      # Client Certificate Key
      # certificate_key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

      # Controls whether the client verifies server certificates and host name.
      # If insecure is set to true, all server host names and certificates will be
      # accepted. In this mode TLS based connections are susceptible to
      # man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing.
      # insecure: true

      # Configure cipher suites to be used for TLS connections
      # cipher_suites: []

      # Configure curve types for ECDHE based cipher suites
      # curve_types: []

  ### File as output
  file:
    # Enabling file output.
    enabled: true

    # Path to the directory where to save the generated files. The option is mandatory.
    path: "/tmp/nginxbeat"

    # Name of the generated files. The default is `nginxbeat` and it generates
    # files: `nginxbeat`, `nginxbeat.1`, `nginxbeat.2`, etc.
    # filename: nginxbeat

    # Maximum size in kilobytes of each file. When this size is reached, the files are
    # rotated. The default value is 10 MB.
    # rotate_every_kb: 10000

    # Maximum number of files under path. When this number of files is reached, the
    # oldest file is deleted and the rest are shifted from last to first. The default
    # is 7 files.
    # number_of_files: 7
